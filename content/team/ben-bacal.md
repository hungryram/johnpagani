Since 2005, Ben Bacal has been setting the standard for luxury real estate in Southern California. An accomplished top-producing agent with over $2 billion in sales, he has orchestrated the purchases of the most iconic residences in the world. Highly sought after for his industry expertise, he’s sold homes to celebrities such as Matt Damon, Ellen DeGeneres, and Madonna, and has also masterminded deals for discerning buyers and sellers who require the utmost discretion.

Born in Toronto, Canada, Ben moved to L.A. at 17 to pursue a degree in film and electronic arts at CSU Long Beach. After graduation, he began selling real estate as a way to finance his cinematic pursuits but quickly found it was his calling. He built his business the old-fashioned way—by knocking on doors. From the beginning, Ben has positioned himself on the cutting-edge of pragmatism, technology, and artistry—he was the first in L.A. to use epic property videos and is a social media influencer with an extensive network.  
Driven by the challenge of achieving the next-level results his clients need, Ben has the ambition and fearlessness required to surmount any obstacle. In 2009, he single-handedly catapulted the median home sale price in two L.A.’s most exclusive neighborhoods—The Bird Streets and Trousdale—1.5X and 2X, respectively. He continues to drive pricing citywide with record-breaking sales in the Hollywood Hills, Bel Air, Beverly Hills Proper, Beverly Hills Post Office, Santa Monica, Venice, Brentwood, Malibu, Westlake, and the Hidden Hills. Whether working with buyers, sellers, or developers, Ben’s integrity, industriousness, and out-of-the-box thinking create the highest echelon of service.

Ben has a history of impeccably marketing distinguished properties, including a record sale in the Hollywood Hills for $40M, 1181 Hillcrest—purchased by the Mind-craft founder for $70 million—and most recently 924 Bel Air Rd., which sold for just under $100 million. However, he prides himself on offering superior service to all of his clients, most of whom are buying and selling within a range of $1–5 million.  
Ben is also a technology auteur and has spearheaded many startups over the years. Forbes called his most recent venture, [Rila](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/rila-social-real-estate/id1389643613), “the Instagram of real estate.” It is set to aid the industry by directing the world’s vast real estate opportunities to a growing millennial consumer base. Just as passionate about giving back as he is about the market, Ben supports environmental organizations and helps build homes for people in need through Give Back Homes. When not hustling, he unwinds by kite surfing, skiing, and painting.
