Ben Quibrera is an English and Spanish speaking native of Los Angeles who has an immense love for this city. After attending UCLA, Ben followed his love for real estate, which started at a vey young age, and began working alongside his family who owned a property management company that managed homes in Pacific Palisades, Brentwood, Santa Monica, West Hollywood and Beverly Hills. Following in the footsteps of his entrepreneurial roots, Ben started his first estate management company in 2009, which lead him to oversee the remodel of multiple homes in the Hollywood Hills in his early 20's. That experience taught Ben the intricacies and the finesse of servicing clients, partners and friends in onerous transactions. Whether buying or selling, Ben has the intrinsic ability to foresee the needs of his clients and work arduously to assist them in achieving their ultimate goal. Whether buying your dream home, selling your home, or looking for a lucrative development opportunity, Ben is here to assist you from start to finish.
