  body_text: Our philosophy is different than that of a franchised real estate company
    because we realize each property is unique. Buyers and Sellers deserve our undivided
    attention. Marketing plans should be flexible, commissions negotiable depending
    upon the transaction, and the customerâ€™s satisfaction should always be the goal.
    We are dedicated to guiding you through the entire selling or buying process to
    assure that your expectations are exceeded each and every time you place your
    trust in Wallstreet Realty. We are using cutting edge technologies and maintaining
    professional relationships to sell your property in a shorter period of time.
    Wallstreet Realty is an easily recognized name for buyers and sellers.
